# Password-Generator

https://paddybarn.github.io/Password-Generator/

In this assignment, we were given base code for a password generator site and asked to make the generator functional and operate with the following requirements:
        GIVEN I need a new, secure password
        WHEN I click the button to generate a password
        THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
        WHEN prompted for password criteria
        THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
        WHEN prompted for the length of the password
        THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
        WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
        THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
        WHEN I answer each prompt
        THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
        WHEN all prompts are answered
        THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
        WHEN the password is generated
        THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Clicking the button "generate password" opens a window prompt.  
The first prompt asks how many characters the user would like their password to be in length.
After character length is selected, another window prompt asks the user which character types,"upper case, lower case, numeric, and special characters", they would like to include in their password.
  If user input does not match the set parameter values.  An alert displays "Error, outside parameter values".
If all parameter values are entered correctly into the window prompts the generator creates a password in an alert.  Then displays it in the text box on the page.

This was a class project.  Therefore outside colaboration is not permitted.
